To change values in the private registry hive by hand, you can use regedit.exe to load a private hive. 

You need to select the HKEY_USERS node, and click the File > Load Hive… menu. 

You select the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\VisualStudio\15.0_<id>\privateregistry.bin file, give a name 
to the hive (I entered VS2017PrivateRegistry) and now you can see the 15.0_<id>_Config key populated as usual

Note: use File > Unload Hive when done
